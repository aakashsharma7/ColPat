# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide 

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).

### Branch Organization

Submit all changes directly to the main branch. We donâ€™t use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases. We do our best to keep main in good shape, with all tests passing.

Code that lands in the main must be compatible with the latest stable release. It may contain additional features, but no breaking changes. We should be able to release a new minor version from the tip of the main at any time.

### How to Report Bugs

In order to report bugs, you should create an issue and describe the bug properly and you can also suggest a way to fix it (in case you know it). You should mention your device details (if possible) so that we can find the fix fast.
